fastcorrelation: a program to quickly compute the two-point correlation function
		 of point sets on small scales, especially of galaxy surveys
		 (on nonlinear scales) and simulations thereof.

Usage:
./auto max_scale box_size filename_of_points
./cross max_scale box_size filename_of_pointsA filename_of_pointsB

Acknowledgements:
This code is a intellectual descendant of a program originally written by
David Weinberg.  The memory layout optimizations are due to ideas implemented
in a separate implementation by Manodeep Sinha.
